<li><em>second-person</em>: over the shoulder camera</li>
<li><em>third-person</em>: being distant, removed, embodying a character, detachment of oneself -&gt; <em>with the character</em>, the avatar is part of the story, part of the mechanics, focused on the space</li>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The main difference is being able to see one&#39;s own body.

<p>The third-person, on the contrary, provides more information to the detriment of seamlessness: you can see who you are (and, as such, the designer can provide yet another layer of information related to the narrative and artistic direction of the world), and you can see what is going on around you better, but it might feel unnatural and somewhat clunky to move around.</p>

<ul>
<li>path dependency: when something exists for a long time, it informs subsequent decisions and strengthens its position as &quot;natural&quot;. A corollary of that is <em>repetition</em>. When something is done over and over, it becomes engrained.</li>
<li>convincing: using rational arguments to make it obvious, through logic, that such a narrative is the &quot;correct&quot; one.</li>
<li>persuading: using emotional and aesthetic approaches to persuade others that the narrative is worth pursuing.</li>

</div><div class="prep" concept="3"><p>having one world implies one truth, which is rendered moot because of, at least, <em>relativity</em>.</p>
<p>indeed, <em>truth is relative</em> (c.f Kurt Gödel)</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="3"><img src="virtual worlds_assets/kurt-goedel.jpg" alt="kurt-goedel.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>The fact that there is only one world falls short quite fast. The perspective of someone in China is as valid as the perspective of someone in Namibia. They might share some aspects, but not all of them. And so these versions overlap, providing <em>common group</em>, or <em>the common thing</em> (Arendt), which is translated into latin, is <em>res publica</em>, the republic. Republics are, in part, systems in which we all agree on a common belief.</p>
<p>Still, even physics are relative, as Einstein has shown us. This was already the case in artistic depictions: is a sunset by Turner, Tintoretto or Manet more truthful than than the others? The question is rather: to what extent, and under which circumstances, is one more truthful than the other?</p>

<p>e.g. <a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDD5OOAcTUg">papers, please</a> putting more emphasis on document manipulation than on decision-making</p>

<p>e.g. categories for lgbtq+ in administrative forms</p>

<p>e.g. having a field for <em>Miss</em> and not for its male counterpart in administrative forms</p>
<p><img src="https://geeko.lesoir.be/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2012/02/femme1.jpg" alt="mademoiselle"></p>
<p>e.g. introducing or removing grading schemas in schools.</p>

<li><p><strong>splitting and combining</strong> focus on separating things that used to be together, that used to be <em>taken for granted</em> when together. Inversely, combining puts seemingly unrelated things together to provide a new coherent whole.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>weighing</strong> is putting more emphasis on some aspects of the world rather than on some previous one. It keeps the previous elements but reorganizes the priority by putting some things at the foreground and somethings in the background.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>ordering</strong> is about putting things in categories. This could involve switching things from one category to another, or creating new categories to put things in.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>deleting and adding</strong> are the most straightforward. This is about bringing in or bringing out things that weren&#39;t there before, introducing ore removing an element which will, in turn, reconfigure the balance of all other existing elements.</p>

</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">assessment</h3><div class="prep" concept="3"><p>if there are no <em>absolutely true</em> worlds, there are nonetheless worlds that are more <em>acceptable</em> than others.</p>
<p>what makes them so?</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="3"><ul>
<li><p>frame of context</p>
</li>
<li><p>usefulness</p>
</li>
<li><p>consistency (internal and external)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>if we consider all truths to be somewhat relative, then the first requirement for determining if a world is a <em>true</em> representation of the world is the <strong>frame of reference</strong>.</p>
<p>Another one is <strong>utility</strong>: to what extent does a world, a statement allow us to correctly predict the future and act upon it? Imagining a world in which we all walk on our heads might not be very useful; imagining a world in which only some of use walk on our heads might be useful to think in terms of accessibility for disabled people.</p>
<p>Finally, a requirement for a world to be taking seriously is its <strong>consistency</strong>. This is both internal (does it contradict itself?) and external (does it contradict other worlds in absurd ways?).</p>
<p>All of these are never guarantors of the truth-value of a world: a vision can be true without being obviously useful, a vision can be useful without being absolutely consistent. Nonetheless, these provide benchmarks to assess to what extent our worlds and our imaginations can be taken seriously and therefore, perhaps, materialized into reality.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="4"><p>This distinction between the what and the how, Aristotle already pointed to it in his book <em>Poetics</em>. In Western philosophy, it&#39;s a long debate between those two parts: the form and the content.</p>
<p>In general, though, it seems that form and content, while distinct, are also inseparable from each other: that the form affects the content and vice-versa. Any surface decision you make will somehow affect how your idea is perceived. Any conceptual direction you&#39;re taking might affect how it is <em>perceived</em> by the public.</p>
<p>I personally would argue that humans often to focus on surface at first, and then second on content. This means that, if we were to trace a hierarchy, or a priority, surface would take precedence.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">-tics</h3><div class="prep" concept="4"><p>this separation, <em>form</em> vs. <em>content</em> has been given several names:</p>

Fiction is that which is thematic (what it says), and diction is that which is formal (how it looks).</p>
<p>However, Genette focuses exclusively on <em>the literary</em>: that which is essentially composed by language (as in, written words). Departing from that, we will use a broader definition of language, including still and moving images, recordings, objects and processes in order to express our world.</p>

<p>Objects can have a range of sizes, from a toothpick to the sixth continent of plastic (often qualifying as hyperobjects).</p>
<p>Particularly, <em>artefacts</em> (cf. Daniel Miller) are means of representing not just individuals (through their choice of using those) but mostly as manifestations of the historical and geographical contexts in which they operate. This isn&#39;t just limited to the, say, masks of &quot;primitive&quot; populations studied by anthropologists such as a Marcel Mauss and Levi-Strauss, but to all objects created by any society, including (and especially!) societies from which anthropologists typically come from.</p>
