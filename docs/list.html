                        The Ark of Life is an end-of-life experience that immerses one in the contemplation of life and death. Every plant in nature, every drop of water in the ocean, and every cell in the human body is constantly moving, transforming, dying, and being born or reborn. They are ephemeral and they are by no means static and eternal. Knowing that we will eventually leave the world creates a specific focus on our activity, life, and present, and the fact that life is not eternal empowers our motions to appreciate it more.

However, in parallel to all those problem, computation power and great developpers manage to create more and more advance AI until a genius created the perfect one, the one who takes care of everything of what was remaining of the humanity and allows it to live in peace. My project is the museum that show what happened during those previous centuries. This museum is visited in the cyberspace that is directly available through chip connected to the brain of the humans of 2500.

The rise of machines has left a society where abundance and productivity have reached a pinnacle. No more drudgery. Though humans are experiencing a renaissance of leisure and fun, a spiritual void persists. Exhibits guests become what this world has forgotten.

                    For this project, I tried to envision a less dystopic future where technology succeeds in its promise to improve the human condition by enabling humanity to explore and eventually colonize worlds currently out of reach. Growth, expansion, and – most importantly – our survival is contingent upon our ability to live off-Earth. Even without distant colonization, the stasis we could provide our planet by reducing our burden on it and living in orbit will be crucial to providing an equitable and hopeful future for all humankind.
