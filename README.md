## course description

the world is a work of carefully assembled, organized and presented pieces of fiction, which intersect more or less intimately with our beliefs and experiences. this course will propose a suspension of disbelief in order to construct virtual cosmogonies in the Unity game engine.

how can we pick, lay out and program texts, images, films, objects, spaces and procedures to persuade a virtual visitor of the coherence of our world?

drawing on environmental storytelling, procedural rhetoric, literary studies and museography, this class will explore how we can build accounts of untold stories, alternate realities and possible worlds.
